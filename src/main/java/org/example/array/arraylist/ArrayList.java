package org.example.array.arraylist;

/*
    Pros:
        - Dynamic size
        - Easy to use
        - Quick access, implement an array behind the scenes
        - Ordering
        - No need to allocate memory
        - Support null storing
    Cons:
        - Thread safety: multiple threads can access and change -> may break data
        - More expensive than array
        - Efficient trade-off
        - Still slower than array
        - Use more memory
